    "description": "The total volume of Kazakhstan's bond market in national currency reached more than 50 trillion tenge (100 billion USD) by the end of 2024. It is necessary to note the balanced structure between the government securities market (XX%) and corporate bonds (YY%). Historically, the bond market, both government and corporate, has developed as exchange-centric, with the accumulative pension system playing a significant role in its development through the Unified Accumulative Pension Fund, which became the main large institutional investor in the bond market."
